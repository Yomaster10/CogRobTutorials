    "\n",
    "* Define a class, which is a sort of blueprint for an object\n",
    "* Instantiate an object from a class\n",
    "* Use attributes and methods to define the properties and behaviors of an object\n",
    "* Use inheritance to create child classes from a parent class\n",
    "* Reference a method on a parent class using `super()`\n",
    "* Check if an object inherits from another class using `isinstance()`"
