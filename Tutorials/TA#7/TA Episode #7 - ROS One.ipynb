    "The **Robot Operating System (ROS)** is a middleware/framework you can use to develop any robotics application: robotic arms, mobile robots, drones, submarines, etc. It is essentially a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications that work across a wide variety of robotic platforms. In this tutorial, you will need to obtain access to a Linux desktop running Ubuntu 20.04, since we will be working with the Noetic **distribution** (version) of ROS 1.\n",

    "## (1) The ROS Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we actually start using ROS, we first need to take a deeper dive into the question \"what actually is ROS?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "First, what it is not: the Robot Operating System, despite its name, is *not* an operating system. Nor it is really a framework. ROS is more of a **middleware**, something like a low-level “framework” based on an existing operating system. The main supported operating system for ROS is the Ubuntu distribution of the Linux OS. ROS is mainly composed of 2 things:\n",
    "- A core (middleware) with communication tools\n",
    "- A set of plug & play libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "It was originally developed in 2007 at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, released stably by a company called Willow Garage in 2010, and since 2013 has been managed by a non-profit organization called Open Robotics. Today it is used by many robots, universities and companies, and it's considered the de facto standard for robot programming.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### (1.1) Why do we actually need ROS?\n",
    "\n",
    "One pretty common story in robotics development is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Someday, a student/engineer starts a new cool robotics project. She starts planning and working on the project. Soon, she discovers that it’s not that simple. Robotics is hard to learn, and it takes time to develop a good software for a robot. So, she starts to spend time working on how to communicate between all her programs, how she can implement a 3D simulation of the robot, etc. The project comes to an end. No real progress was made, and the developer starts to loose faith. She has spent all her time trying to write a robotics framework, but worked only a little on the actual project. Soon the project is abandoned, or maybe she manages to finish something with some hacked code. A few weeks later, another guy starts another new cool robotics project. He thinks: what if I find some framework I can directly use? He finds her code on the Internet, but the code seems really not reusable for his own application. So, he starts writing everything from scratch. And so on, and so forth. Many people who are working in robot software development don’t actually develop robotics applications. They develop robotics framework that ends up being non reusable, not supported, not known, and quickly forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/angery2.jpg\" width=600/>\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/angery1.jpeg\" width=475/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation often happens for people doing a PhD, with a 2-3 years time frame for the project. This is one of the main factor slowing down robotics research and development, and ROS is trying to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROS allows you to stop \"reinventing the wheel\". Reinventing the wheel is one of the main killers for new innovative applications. The ROS goal is to provide a standard for robotics software development, that you can use on any robot. Whether you are programming a mobile robot, a robotic arm, a drone, a boat, a vending machine, well... You can use Robot Operating System. And every time you start a new application, it becomes easier. You don’t have to re-learn how to use ROS. You can also easily switch to an existing ROS project developed by someone else and not be lost. The time has end when each new robotics application is developed from scratch, with a different code base every time. This standard allows you to actually focus on the key features of your application, using an existing foundation, instead of trying to do everything yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (1.2) So, what is a Middleware?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, a middleware is responsible for handling the communication between programs in a distributed system. When developing a new software, should you: (A) develop one code base with everything compiling and running in one block, or (B) create sub programs, one for each sub task/functionality of your application?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagination, the second option is the best when developing a robotics software. You really need to be able to develop one part of your application (let’s say, a driver for a sensor), and run it without the whole application. So, you’re now writing many small modules, and they need to communicate between each other. ROS **core** is here to help you do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (1.3) ROS Core & Communication Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "With ROS, you will be able to easily separate your code base into **packages** containing small programs, called **nodes**. How can we make these programs communicate between each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, ROS comes in with 3 main communication tools:\n",
    "- **Topics:** Those will be used mainly for sending data streams between nodes. Example: you’re monitoring the temperature of a motor on the robot. The node monitoring this motor will send a data stream with the temperature. Now, any other node can subscribe to this topic and get the data. (We will only use topics in this course)\n",
    "- **Services:** They will allow you to create a simple synchronous client/server communication between nodes. Very useful for changing a setting on your robot, or ask for a specific action: enable freedrive mode, ask for specific data, etc.\n",
    "- **Action:** A little bit more complex, they are in fact based on topics. They exist to provide you with an asynchronous client/server architecture, where the client can send a request that takes a long time (ex: asking to move the robot to a new location). The client can asynchronously monitor the state of the server, and cancel the request anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use those communication tools, you’ll simply have to use the appropriate libraries in your code, and define specific **messages**. In your ROS environment you’ll also be able to create some global settings, called **parameters**, so multiple nodes can get access to the same set of settings from anywhere in the robotics application. And you’ll be able to launch your complete application with just one XML file, called a **launch file**. ROS also includes a complete **logging** system, which is quite easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/ROS_arch.png\" width=600/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "With all those features, you have everything you need to develop a distributed system. You’ll break your application into many packages, and each package will contain some independent nodes. Once you’ve created your nodes, you’ll make them communicate with each other using topics, services and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if it seems like I'm just throwing a bunch of keywords at you here; we'll discuss all of the important ones more in depth together!"

    "### (1.4) ROS Nodes & Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "As you start to learn ROS, you’ve quickly discovered that everything in ROS is made with components called nodes. So, what is a ROS node?\n",
    "\n",
    "A ROS **node** is basically a process that performs computation. It is an executable program running inside your application. You will write many nodes and put them into packages. Nodes are combined into a graph and communicate with each other using ROS topics, services, actions, etc. Note that 2 nodes can’t have the same name. If you want to run multiple instances of the same node, you’ll have to add a prefix or suffix to the name, or declare them as anonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about these packages that I mentioned?\n",
    "\n",
    "Software in ROS is organized into **packages**. A package might contain ROS nodes, a ROS-independent library, a dataset, configuration files, a third-party piece of software, or anything else that logically constitutes a useful module. The goal of these packages it to provide this useful functionality in an easy-to-consume manner so that software can be easily reused. In general, ROS packages follow a \"Goldilocks\" principle: enough functionality to be useful, but not too much that the package is heavyweight and difficult to use from other software. Packages are easy to create by hand or with tools like `catkin_create_pkg` (more on this later). Packages are the most atomic unit of build and the unit of release. This means that a package is the smallest individual thing you can build in ROS and it is the way software is bundled for release.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (1.5) ROS Topics, Messages, Subscibers, & Publishers\n",
    "\n",
    "A ROS **topic** is named bus over which nodes exchange **messages**. Think of it like a communication channel through which our nodes can talk to each other in order to share information. Technically speaking, the messages are sent over TCP/IP ([Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite)). The ROS libraries that you will use in your code will provide you with enough abstraction so you don’t have to deal with the TCP/IP layer. The messages themselves are simple data structures comprising typed fields, which support standard primitive types (integer, floating point, boolean, etc.) as well as arrays of primitive types. Messages are usually stored in [.msg](http://wiki.ros.org/msg) files.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node can either **subscribe** to a topic (i.e. listen to it) or **publish** to a topic (i.e. send data through it). The data stream through topics is unidirectional, meaning that some nodes can publish on the topic, and some nodes can subscribe to the topic. There is no response from a subscriber to a publisher, the data is only going one way. It's also important to note that publishers and subscribers are anonymous. A publishers only knows it is publishing to a topic, and a subscriber only knows it is subscribing to a topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/ros_topic.gif\" width=600/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every topic has a message type. All publishers and subscribers on this topic must use the *same* message type associated with the topic. Lastly, a node can contain many publishers and subscribers for many different topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (1.6) ROS Master\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ROS Master** provides naming and registration services to the rest of the nodes in the ROS system. It tracks publishers and subscribers to topics as well as services. The role of the Master is to enable individual ROS nodes to locate one another. Once these nodes have located each other they communicate with each other peer-to-peer. When a node wants to publish something, it will inform the ROS master. When another node wants to subscribe to a topic, it will ask the ROS master from where it can get the data. You can see the ROS master as a telephone operator that \"connects\" the nodes to each other so that they can communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/rosmaster.png\" width=600/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Master is most commonly run using the `roscore` command, which loads the ROS Master along with other essential components. If we don't run this command and turn on the Master, we won't be able to run anything else!\n",
    "\n",
    "### (1.7) Summary of Important Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Package:** The basic building block for ROS projects; every ROS application is built with packages\n",
    "- **Node:** A computational process which runs as an executable program in a package\n",
    "- **Message:** A simple data structure comprising typed fields, which supports standard primitive types (integer, floating point, boolean, etc.) as well as arrays of primitive types\n",
    "- **Topic:** A named bus over which nodes exchange messages; it is defined by its name and the data type it supports (i.e. the message)\n",
    "- **Subscriber:** A node that subscribes to the messages and information being published on a topic\n",
    "- **Publisher:** A node that publishes a specific type of message over a given topic; subscribers can access messages published to this topic\n",

    "## (2) Getting Started with ROS Noetic\n",
    "\n",
    "### (2.1) Sourcing the Setup File\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the basic concepts of ROS, let's dig in!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have ROS Noetic installed on your Linux device, you need to tell the computer where to find ROS before you can actually turn it on. We will do so using the following command, which we run in the terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will need to run this command on every new shell (terminal tab) you open to have access to the ROS commands, unless you add this line to your `.bashrc` file (this file is automatically run when you open a new shell). This process allows you to install several ROS distributions (for example, ROS1 Noetic and ROS2 Foxy, which both run on Ubuntu 20) on the same computer and switch between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make life easier, we can add an **alias** to our `.bashrc` file that will allow us to source ROS noetic with a shorter (and easier to remember command). To do this, run the following command in your terminal: `nano ~/.bashrc`. This will open the `.bashrc` file in the `nano` text editor. Scroll down to the bottom of the file, and add the following line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  alias noetic='source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash'\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Press `Ctrl+X` to save your changes and exit the text editor. Run the command `source ~/.bashrc` to tell your shell that the `.bashrc` file has been changed (you only need to do this in the shell where you edited the file, you don't need to do this when you open new shells afterward), then run the command `noetic`. If this runs without errors, it means your computer has successfully located ROS Noetic!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can run the following command to add the alias command straight to the `.bashrc` file without needing to even open it in a text editor:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  echo \"alias noetic='source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash'\" >> ~/.bashrc\n",
    "  source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you want your computer to automatically source ROS Noetic upon loadup, you can just change the line we added to the `.bashrc` file to just `source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash`. This automatically tells the computer to run the source command every time you open a new terminal shell, and you'll never need to worry about sourcing again! This is a perfectly valid solution, so long as you don't intend to use other ROS distributions (such as ROS2 Foxy) from the same desktop. In that cases, using aliases will be preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (2.2) Turning on the ROS Master\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've sourced the setup file and our computer knows where ROS Noetic is located, we can run the `roscore` command in the terminal in order to turn on the ROS Master. Note that this command will only work in shells where you've sourced the setup file (i.e. ran the command `noetic`)! If this worked properly, you should something like the following output in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/roscore.png\" width=700/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in the figure above how I initially tried to run `roscore` without running `noetic` (and thus sourcing the setup file) first, and the computer immediately returned an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "### (2.3) Checking the Active Nodes and Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Once `roscore` is running in one shell, leave it alone for now and open another shell, where you'll source ROS again (i.e. run the `noetic` command). Now that the ROS Master is running, we want to be able to get information about which nodes and topics are available and running. For this purpose, we can use the following command-line tools:\n",
    "- `rosnode`: A command-line tool for displaying debug information about ROS nodes, including publications, subscriptions and connections\n",
    "- `rostopic`: A command-line tool for displaying debug information about ROS topics, including publishers, subscribers, publishing rate, and ROS messages\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what we can do with these tools, first run the command `rosnode -h` in your terminal (the `-h` command-line argument indicates that you request further information, or \"help\", regarding the command preceding it). You should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/rosnode_h.png\" width=600/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that there are a variety of options for use with this tool, but the main ones we'll need are `list`, `info`, and `kill`. First, let's run the command `rosnode list` to get a list of the ROS nodes that are currently active. Doing so, we see that there is only one such node for now, called `/rosout`. We want to learn more about this node, and to do so we run the command `rosnode info /rosout`. We should see the following output after doing so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/rosnode_info.png\" width=350/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This output tells us a few thing about the node: it subscribes to a topic called `/rosout` (it's okay for a node and a topic to have the same name) which carries messages of an unknown type, and it publishes messages of type `rosgraph_msgs/Log` to a topic called `/rosout_agg`. In general, all active nodes will publish their debug messages to the `/rosout` topic, and the `/rosout` node will retrieve these messages (through its subscription to that topic) and forward them along to the `/rosout_agg` topic as `rosgraph_msgs/Log` messages, which are the underlying message data structure for **logging** to rosout. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if we wanted to disable an active node like `/rosout` we could run `rosnode kill /rosout`, but we kinda need that node - let's not kill it just yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's see what we can do with the `rostopic` tool, by first running the command `rostopic -h` in your terminal. You should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/rostopic_h.png\" width=600/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We again see that there are a variety of options for use with this tool, but the main ones we'll need are `list`, `info`, and `echo`. First, let's run the command `rostopic list` to get a list of the ROS topics that are currently active. Doing so, we see that there are two active topics now (which we saw before), called `/rosout` and `/rosout_agg`. We want to learn more about these topics, and to do so we run the command `rostopic info /rosout`, then `rostopic info /rosout_agg`. We should see the following output after doing so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/rostopic_info.png\" width=350/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This output tells us a few thing about each topic:\n",
    "- The `/rosout` topic has no publishers (i.e. no nodes are publishing to it, it's not receiving any data) and it has one subscriber, the node called `/rosout` (here we notice that this topic has message type `rosgraph_msgs/Log`, whereas before the output of `rosnode info /rosout` indicated that this topic had an unknown type - weird stuff!).\n",
    "- The `/rosout_agg` topic has no subscribers (i.e. no nodes are subscribed to it, it's not sending out any data) and it has one publisher, again the node `/rosout`, which sends it messages of type `rosgraph_msgs/Log`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use the `echo` argument for the `rostopic` tool to print the messages in a topic directly to our terminal - this is usually quite helpful for debugging. If we run the command `rostopic echo /rosout` (or `rostopic echo /rosout_agg`), we'll notice that nothing happens. This is because there is no data being set through this topic yet, and we'll come back to this later."

    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to examine nodes and topics directly from the command line, let's actually run a ROS node ourselves and see what happens! To run an executable node, we will use the `rosrun` command, which allows us to run an executable in an arbitrary package from anywhere without having to specify its full path. We will do so in the following form: `rosrun <package> <executable>`, where `<package>` is the package name and `<executable>` is the name of the executable (i.e. the node) that we want to run. In this case, we want to run the node `turtlesim_node` from the package `turtlesim` (this package was installed automatically when you installed ROS - think of it like the ROS version of \"Hello World!\"). We can do so by running the following command:\n",

    "### (3.1) Catkin Workspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end we will use **workspaces**, which are sets of directories (or folders) where you store related pieces of ROS code. The official name for workspaces in ROS is **catkin workspaces**. The word \"catkin\" comes from the tail-shaped flower cluster found on willow trees; this is a reference to the company Willow Garage (as we mentioned earlier, they released ROS back in 2010). All the ROS packages that you create need to reside inside a catkin workspace. The name of this catkin workspace is typically called `catkin_ws` (though this isn't a must).\n",
    "\n",
    "**catkin** is the official build system of ROS. A build system is responsible for generating \"targets\" from raw source code that can be used by an end user. In ROS terminology, source code is organized into \"packages\" where each package typically consists of one or more targets when built. A catkin workspace is a folder where you modify, build, and install catkin packages. The catkin workspace contains the following spaces:\n",
    "- **Source (Src) Space:** The source space contains the source code of catkin packages. This is where you can extract/checkout/clone source code for the packages you want to build.\n",
    "- **Build Space:** The build space is where CMake is invoked to build the catkin packages in the source space. CMake and catkin keep their cache information and other intermediate files here.\n",
    "- **Development (Devel) Space:** The development space (or devel space) is where built targets are placed prior to being installed.\n",

Running it the first time in your workspace, it will create a `CMakeLists.txt` link in your `src` folder. Additionally, if you look in your current directory you should now have a `build` and `devel` folder. Inside the `devel` folder you can see that there are now several `setup.*sh` files. Sourcing any of these files will overlay this workspace on top of your environment. Before continuing on, you must source your new `setup.*sh` file using the following command (this tells your computer to work from the workspace, and to check for updates to it when necessary):\n",
    "```\n",
    "  source devel/setup.bash\n",

    "- The package must contain a catkin compliant `package.xml` file\n",
    "    - That `package.xml` file provides meta information about the package\n",
    "- The package must contain a `CMakeLists.txt` which uses catkin\n",
    "    - If it is a catkin metapackage, it must have the relevant boilerplate `CMakeLists.txt` file\n",
    "- Each package must have its own folder\n",
    "    - This means no nested packages nor multiple packages sharing the same directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest possible package might have a structure which looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_package/\n",
    "  CMakeLists.txt\n",
    "  package.xml\n",
    "```\n",
    "The recommended method of working with catkin packages is using a catkin workspace, but you can also build catkin packages standalone (we shan't do this, though). A trivial workspace might look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "workspace_folder/        -- WORKSPACE\n",
    "  src/                   -- SOURCE SPACE\n",

    "      CMakeLists.txt     -- CMakeLists.txt file for package_n\n",
    "      package.xml        -- Package manifest for package_n\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, we will demonstrate how to use the `catkin_create_pkg` script to create a new catkin package, and what you can do with it after it has been created. Change to the source space directory (`/src`) of the catkin workspace you created previously:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  cd ~/catkin_ws/src\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `catkin_create_pkg` command requires that you give it a `package_name` and optionally a list of dependencies on which that package depends:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In our case, we'll create a simple package called `tut7_pkg` that relis on `std_msgs`, `rospy`, `roscpp`: \n",
    "```\n",
    "  catkin_create_pkg tut7_pkg std_msgs rospy roscpp\n",
    "```\n",

The `package.xml` file is called the **package manifest**, and it is an XML file that must be included with any catkin-compliant package's root folder. This file defines properties about the package such as the package name, version numbers, authors, maintainers, and dependencies on other catkin packages. You can read more about this file [here](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/package.xml). The file `CMakeLists.txt` is the input to the CMake build system for building software packages. Any CMake-compliant package contains one or more `CMakeLists.txt` file that describe how to build the code and where to install it to. The `CMakeLists.txt` file used for a catkin project is a standard vanilla `CMakeLists.txt` file with a few additional constraints, and you can read more about it [here](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt).\n",

    "```\n",
    "This loop is a fairly standard `rospy` construct: checking the `rospy.is_shutdown()` flag and then doing work. You have to check `is_shutdown()` to check if your program should exit (e.g. if there is a `Ctrl-C` or otherwise). In this case, the \"work\" is a call to `pub.publish(hello_str)` that publishes a string to our `chatter` topic. The loop calls `rate.sleep()`, which sleeps just long enough to maintain the desired rate through the loop (you may also run across `rospy.sleep()`, which is similar to `time.sleep()` except that it works with simulated time as well). This loop also calls `rospy.loginfo(str)`, which performs triple-duty: the messages get printed to screen, it gets written to the Node's log file, and it gets written to `rosout` (which is a handy tool for debugging when using the [rqt_console](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_console) package, but we won't discuss this here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on, we should discuss the fact that `std_msgs.msg.String` is a very simple message type, and so you may be wondering what it looks like to publish more complicated types. The general rule of thumb is that constructor args are in the same order as in the `.msg` file. You can also pass in no arguments and initialize the fields directly, e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "msg = String()\n",
    "msg.data = str\n",
    "```\n",
    "or you can initialize some of the fields and leave the rest with default values:\n",
    "```\n",
    "String(data=str)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are working with `geometry_msgs.msg.Twist` messages, for example when dealing with the data being passed through the `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic in the TurtleSim tool, I might want to assign the linear velocity in the *x*-direction and the angular velocity about the *z*-axis to the `Twist` message as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "twist = Twist()\n",
    "twist.linear.x = 2.0\n",
    "twist.angular.z = 1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "I can then publish this `Twist` message to the relevant topic (i.e. `/turtle1/cmd_vel`) using `pub.publish(twist)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can examine the last little bit of the `talker.py` file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "      if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "            try:\n",
    "                  talker()\n",
    "            except rospy.ROSInterruptException:\n",
    "                  pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "In addition to the standard Python `__main__` check, this catches a `rospy.ROSInterruptException` exception, which can be thrown by `rospy.sleep()` and `rospy.Rate.sleep()` methods when `Ctrl-C` is pressed or your Node is otherwise shutdown. The reason this exception is raised is so that you don't accidentally continue executing code after the `sleep()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to write a node to receive the messages from our publisher node.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (3.3.2) The Subscriber Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll create the subscriber (\"listener\") node which will continually listen for broadcasted messages. Making sure that your current directory is still `~/catkin_ws/src/tut7_pkg/scripts`, copy the `listener.py` file provided to you with this TA into this directory, and run the following command to make it executable:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    chmod +x listener.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, edit the `catkin_install_python(...)` line of code in the `CMakeLists.txt` file (same line we edited earlier for the `talker.py` file) to look as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "catkin_install_python(PROGRAMS scripts/talker.py scripts/listener.py\n",
    "  DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The subscriber node is now ready to be compiled, but let's again first look at the code in the `listener.py` file to get a better idea of how we actually write subscriber nodes:"
