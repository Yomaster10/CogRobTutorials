In such cases, algorithms like the ones we've explored so far will simply fail to scale up efficiently to suit our needs. Another issue we face is the explicit representation of the free space $\\mathcal{X}_{free}$ (and thus an explicit representation of the C-space) needed for these algorithms to work; while this is simple for a point robot (since it's identical to the workspace $\\mathcal{W}$) and a bit less simple for a polygonal robot traversing convex polygonal obstalces (using a method involving [Minkowski sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition)), this will become more and more difficult as our environments become more complex.\n",

    "### (1.3) A Closer Look\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1.3.1) Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the last part, there are four stages in most sampling-based motion planning algorithms. Let's begin by examining the first stage of the whole process, which is the sampling of the configurations. Sampling methods can be broken up into two different approaches in general: deterministic methods and random methods. In this course, we will focus on random methods, which rely on some form of random number generators in order to choose which configurations to sample next from the C-space. The most common and simple random sampling method is uniform random sampling, whereby we will randomly sample a value for each DOF from a uniform distribution $U[a,b]$ (where $a,b$ are the lower and upper bounds of that DOF in the workspace). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we have the following 2D workspace (left) and corresponding C-space (right):\n",

    "  <img src=\"Graphics/Sampling0.png\" width=700/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said before, we know nothing about the C-space (and we don't need to), and thus we represent it as being empty here (though of course it is not). We have sampled the purple point from $\\mathcal{X}$, and now we want to check if this point is also in $\\mathcal{X}_{free}$ so that we will be able to add it to our roadmap. Using forward kinematics, we can find the pose of the robot in our workspace in order to see if there are any collisions (we will discuss how we can actually detect them a bit later):\n",

We can also see the C-space representation for this collision on the right, though it is again important to note that we did not obtain this representation from this method (we would have to sample $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ points in order to build such a representation like that).\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of our algorithm, we will not give up here, but rather we'll sample again from the C-space in the hopes of obtaining a point in the free space:\n",

    "</p>\n",

    "Random sampling approaches display excellent practical performance and are very commonly used today, but sometimes we might want to have a bit more certainty and control over results for our motion planning problems (for example, NASA initially refused to use random sampling-based methods on their Mars rovers due to their desire to limit uncertainty wherever possible). In such cases, we could use determinstic sampling methods, which will return the same results every single time (this also has the advantage of allowing us to use offline computation to improve real-time execution). For example, we could use grids for this purpose (similar idea to what we saw last tutorial). We could also use sequences of numbers that appear random but are fully deterministic, such as Halton sequences:\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, we might want to consider one problem with the lack of knowledge about obstacles when sampling (i.e. the lack of an explicit representation for $\\mathcal{X}$): narrow passages. We had this sample problem last class, when we discussed grid-based search - sometimes we will run into cases where feasible paths must cross through some sort of narrow passage between obstacles, and if we don't sample enough points that we might not be able to reach the resolution needed for such paths. The figure below shows us an example of one such case:\n",

    "\n",
    "Once we take a sample and ensure that it is in the free space (i.e. we find $q_{rand}\\in\\mathcal{X}_{free}$), we add it as a vertex to the roadmap $\\mathcal{G}$ and then seek to create edges between it and the other vertices already in $\\mathcal{G}$. Rather than try to connect this sample to all vertices in $\\mathcal{G}$, we'll prefer to only connect it to a certain subset of those vertices. We will choose those vertices to be the closest vertices to our sample, and we will use *nearest neighbor* (NN) algorithms to find them. There are two general approaches for deciding which/how many neighbors we want to consider:\n",
    "- Connect the sample to all points within a distance of $r$ from it ($r$-NN)\n",
    "- Connect the sample to the $k$ closest points to it ($k$-NN)\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric for distance/closeness is determined by us (usually just Euclidean distance, which is easy to calculate), as is the value of $r$ or $k$. Once we've done so, conducting the nearest neighbors search is actually quite easy and can be done in $O(n)$ time (where $n$ is the number of vertices currently in $\\mathcal{G}$). All we need to do is iterate over all of the vertices in $\\mathcal{G}$, calculate the distances between them and our sample, and add them as neighbors if this distance is less than $r$ or keep a running list (heap) of the best $k$ neighbors.\n",
    "\n",

    "In Voronoi diagrams, for example, we have some set of points in space (we'll call them seeds), and for each seed we construct a cell in the diagram such that all points within that cell are closer to that seed than any other seed. Using such diagrams, conducting a nearest neighbors search is equivalent to identifying the Voronoi cell in which our sample is located, and returning the seed of that cell (i.e. this works for $k=1$, there are ways to modify it to work for $k>1$ but they're not so great).\n",

    "#### (1.3.3) Local Planning & Collision-Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "When we add vertices (stage 1) or edges (stage 2) to our roadmap $\\mathcal{G}$, we need to make sure that they do not incur any collisions with obstacle in the robot's workspace. This is a simpler task when it comes to vertices, since we only need to check that a single configuration is collision-free in the workspace. There are exact geometric methods for doing so, and this will usually be most efficient when we can model our obstacles and robot using polygons (checking intersections between line segments is relatively easy). In cases where the geometry of our robot or obstacles is too complex, we can use methods such as *bounding volumes*. In such cases, we will build a geometric object (for example, a rectangular prism) called a bounding volume that completely contains the object of interest, an example of which can be seen in the figure below:\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/RabbitBV.png\" width=400/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if the robot (or its bounding volume) does not collide with any obstacles (or their bounding volumes) for a given configuration, then we know for certain that this configuration is indeed collision-free.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of edges, things get a bit more complicated since we need to consider a continuous sequence of configurations and ensure that there are never any collisions. We can do this exactly using methods like computing *swept volumes*, but this is usually computationally expensive. An alternative is to just discretize the path (edge) into a set of configurations and check that those configurations are all collision-free (for example, using bounding volumes). For example:\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphics/DiscretePath.png\" width=500/>\n",
    "</p>\n",

But how exactly should our robot traverse $\\mathcal{G}$ to get from the start to the goal?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1.3.4) Pathfinding\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our final roadmap $\\mathcal{G}$ ready with collision-free vertices and edges, it's time to run a pathfinding algorithm like A* or Dijkstra on it in order to determine the best path between the start point and the goal point. It's important to note that most (if not all) sampling-based motion planning algorithms are classically incomplete, i.e. our roadmap might not contain any valid paths between the start and the goal. To increase the likelihood of returning a valid solution, we can always try increase the number of samples we take (if the algorithm is probabilistically complete, this is bound to work sooner or later) or increase the number of neighbors we consider (i.e. increase $k$ or $r).\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the search algorithms, you might remember that we discussed the A* algorithm in Tutorial #3, during which we saw that the A* search explores nodes in order of decreasing $f$ values, where $f(n)=g(n)+h(n)$ ($g(n)$ is the cost to go to the node $n$ from the start, and $h(n)$ is an admissible heuristic which underestimates the cost to come to the goal from that node). An example run of the A* algorithm on a graph is shown below:\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "While we've mentioned Dijkstra's algorithm before (for example, Tutorial #9), we never formally discussed it. This algorithm conducts an uninformed search on a graph (not on trees) by order of lowest cost ($g$) value - in this respect it is similar to Uniform Cost Search (UCS). The general form of Dijkstra's algorithm does not terminate upon reaching the goal node (unlike UCS), but rather it will update the cost-to-go value (i.e. the $g$ value from the start node) for all nodes in the graph until they are all minimal. Thus, Dijkstra not only provides us with the lowest-cost path from the start node to the goal node, but also the lowest-cost path from the start node to any goal in the graph! We can modify it to terminate upon reaching a goal node if we only care about finding the lowest-cost path between the start and the goal. An example run of Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph (where $a$ is the start node and $b$ is the goal node) is shown below:\n",

A common value used is 0.05, meaning that we will sample the goal node 5% of the time. The goal biasing method will encourage our tree to grow towards the goal, and the higher the goal bias value is the more our tree will want to grow towards the goal. Note that sampling the goal doesn't necessarily mean we will terminate in that step - if the straight-line path between the goal node and its nearest neighbor in the tree is not collision-free, then we must keep searching and growing our tree!\n",

    "A common modification to the RRT algorithm that often improves its performance involves the use of a function called extend. Rather than directly connecting our sampled node to its nearest node in the tree, we will use the extend function to \"move in the direction of\" $x_{rand}$ from $x_{near}$ by a value of $\\eta$ (this is called the step-size, and it is usually small). \n",

    " \n",
    "We will add the point $x_{new}$ that is $\\eta$ distance away from $x_{near}$ in the direction of $x_{rand}$ to our tree then, instead of $x_{rand}$ itself. This will allow our tree to grow in a more \"refined\" and precise manner, and is the often preferred version of this algorithm. The following animation might help you get a better idea of the behavior of this algorithm:\n",

    "Rather than terminate immediately once the goal is added to the tree, we can alternatively set some total number of samples to take $n$, and continue sampling and building the tree until we've completed $n$ iterations. In such cases, we can improve the solution quality if new, better paths to the goal are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While this algorithm is *probabilistically complete*, it is unfortunately *not asymptotically optimal* - we will always return the first solution we obtain, regardless of its quality. Can we change the algorithm in any way to make it asymptotitcally optimal? Long story short, the answer is yes and it involves modified version of RRT called RRT*.\n",
